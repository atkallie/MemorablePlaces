/*
Add the navigation controller and check off 'Is Initial View Controller'
 
The button that you add is a 'Bar Button Item' and you drag and drop it to the layout bar to place it on the toolbar (as opposed to directly on the screen)
 
 The file that you create is a subclass of a UITableViewController, not a UIViewController like you're normally used to


Realize that this is incomplete because it does not recognize panning (keeps re-homing to current location if you drag after pressing the '+' button); will try to return to this once I learn more about gesture recognizers
